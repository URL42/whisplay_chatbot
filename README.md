# Whisplay-AI-Chatbot

This is a pocket-sized AI chatbot device built using a Raspberry Pi Zero 2w. Just press the button, speak, and it talks backâ€”like a futuristic walkie-talkie with a mind of its own.

## Hardware

* Raspberry Pi zero 2w
* PiSugar Whisplay HAT (including LCD screen, on-board speaker and microphone)
* PiSugar 3 1200mAh

## Drivers

You need to firstly install the audio drivers for the Whisplay HAT. Follow the instructions in the [Whisplay HAT repository](https://github.com/PiSugar/whisplay).

## Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PiSugar/whisplay-ai-chatbot.git
   cd whisplay-ai-chatbot
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bash install_dependencies.sh
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.template` file and fill in the necessary environment variables.
4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   bash build.sh
   ```
5. Start the chatbot service:
   ```bash
   bash run_chatbot.sh
   ```
6. Optionally, set up the chatbot service to start on boot:
   ```bash
   sudo bash startup.sh
   ```
   Please note that this will disable the graphical interface and set the system to multi-user mode, which is suitable for headless operation.
