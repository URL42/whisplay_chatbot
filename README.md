# Whisplay-AI-Chatbot

This is a pocket-sized AI chatbot device built using a Raspberry Pi Zero 2w. Just press the button, speak, and it talks backâ€”like a futuristic walkie-talkie with a mind of its own.

## Hardware

* Raspberry Pi zero 2w
* PiSugar Whisplay HAT (developing, including LCD screen, on-board speaker and micphone)
* PiSugar 3 1200mAh

## Enclosure

* Support speaker recognition
